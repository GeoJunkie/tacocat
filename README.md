# Tacocat Spelled Backwards

This is a plugin I'm using to practice the concepts taught in [Professional WordPress Plugin Development, 2nd Edition](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Professional+WordPress+Plugin+Development%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119666936).

It reverses text. Just for fun.

## Development

Uses the [@wordpress/env npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env)
